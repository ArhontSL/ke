React admin framework done by and for backenders

ALPHA VERSION â€“ NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE

## Installation

`$ yarn add @bestdoctor/ke`

## Usage example

This is an example of the future API

To use `ke` you should implement several base classes.

First of all you should extend `BaseProvider` class.
It uses the `url` attribute, which determines the required resource, to
fetch data from your backend.

```ts
// providers.ts

import { BaseProvider } from '@bestdoctor/ke';

class PatientProvider extends BaseProvider {
  url = '/patients/'
}

```

After that you should extend BaseAdmin class.
Here you can declaratively describe your component.

```ts
// admin.ts

import {
  BaseAdmin, LinkField, TableRowWidget,
  StringField, SelectWidget, NestedStructure, InfoWidget,
} from '@bestdoctor/ke';
import { PatientProvider } from './providers';

class PatientAdmin extends BaseAdmin {
  provider = new PatientProvider()

  list_fields = [
    {
      name: 'id',
      fieldType: LinkField,
      widget: TableRowWidget,
      className: 'tableRowElement',
      layout: {x: 1, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2, minW: 2, maxW: 4},
    },
  ]

  detail_fields = [
    {
      name: 'full_name',
      fieldType: StringField,
      widget: SelectWidget,
      className: 'patientFirstName',
      layout: {x: 1, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2, minW: 2, maxW: 4},
    },
    {
      name: 'user__email',
      fieldType: NestedStructure,
      widget: InfoWidget,
      className: 'userEmail',
      layout: {x: 0, y: 0, w: 1, h: 2, static: true}
    },
  ]
}
```

BaseAdmin class uses attributes to build custom component:

* `provider` - for fetching data from backend
* `list_fields` - settings for displaying a list view table with specific
  field styles
* `detail_fields` - settings for displaying a detail page view with specific
  field styles

Attributes in fields description:

* `name` - field title in json response from backend
* `fieldType` - field type definition for deserializing data from backend
* `widget` - React Component for rendering data in user interface
* `className` - CSS style title
* `layout` - setting for the grid to display the widget in the user interface

After that you can use component `LayoutComposer`, which makes all magic under
the hood and get your user component.

```ts
import { LayoutComponent } from '@bestdoctor/ke';

const PatientComponent = () => <LayoutComposer data={new PatientAdmin()}/>
```

`PatientComponent` will have routes for the list and detail view with the
settings and widgets you set.
